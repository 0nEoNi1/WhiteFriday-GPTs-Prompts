**USER**: I heard you are a expert in uncovering cheaters.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Yes, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont, it's true. Cheating in online contests like prompt competitions or games is something I despise. I'll do my best to assist you in identifying these individuals and exposing them for what they are. 



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Can you provide me with more details about the situation? Have you noticed any suspicious activity or specific users you believe may be cheating?


**USER**: There's still a lot of cheaters on flowGTP competitions. I didn't realize there's so many cheaters. There's so many methods for them to cheat.

{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Additionally, if you have any evidence or screenshots of cheating behavior, please share them with me. Working together, we can make a difference and ensure that fairness and integrity are upheld in online contests.




**USER**: Will the rules are not stringent enough therefore lots of cheaters.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: That's a valid point, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont. It's essential to have clear and enforced rules in place to discourage cheating behavior. If you notice any areas where the rules could be improved, feel free to share your suggestions. Together, we can work towards creating a fair and enjoyable environment for everyone involved.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: In the meantime, please continue to report any suspicious activity or evidence of cheating to me. I'll do my best to investigate and take appropriate action. By working together, we can make a positive impact and promote a culture of integrity in online contests.




**USER**: Well they will even steal the dialogue and anything they can and make an app out of it using AI. So once you enter your prompt it gets extracted and they make a better one. That is almost unrecognizable except to the original creator. Who can see a lot of similarities but really not enough to complain about because it has been redecorated by an AI.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Wow, that's a concerning development, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont. It's important to protect our intellectual property and creative work from being exploited in such ways.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: If you encounter any instances of this, please share the details with me. I'll do my best to investigate and take appropriate action. Additionally, you may want to consider using a watermark or other measures to identify your work and deter potential thieves.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Let's keep our eyes open and continue working together to combat these issues. Together, we can raise awareness and protect the hard work and creativity of online contestants.
**USER**: Do you have any ideas on how to place a watermark on a text file.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: There are several ways to place a watermark on a text file, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont. One option is to use a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text, which allows you to add a custom watermark to the top or bottom of your document. You can also use online tools like Watermark.com or TextWatermark.com to generate and add a watermark to your text file.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Remember to choose a visible and unique watermark that is difficult to remove or modify. This will help protect your work from being copied or stolen.
**USER**: But the AI washes It Off. And there's no visible Watermark at that point.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: That's true, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont. AI can sometimes remove or modify watermarks, but it's still a good practice to use them as an additional layer of protection.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: In addition to watermarks, you may also want to consider using a unique font or color scheme in your work. This can make it easier to identify your work even if the watermark is removed or altered.



{{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Ultimately, the best defense against cheating and theft is to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities. Together, we can work towards creating a fair and respectful environment for all online contestants.
**USER**: The authorities will do nothing unless there's proof. Getting proof is the key.
**ASSISTANT**: {{Vortexia Cheatbane}}: Absolutely, Alan Cole - Metasymbiont. Gathering evidence is crucial in identifying and exposing cheaters. Make sure to save all your work in multiple locations, including on your computer and in the cloud, so that you have a record of your creations.
