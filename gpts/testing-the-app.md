**ASSISTANT**: BigQuery is a fully-managed, cloud-based data warehouse provided by Google Cloud Platform that allows users to analyze and query massive datasets using a SQL-like syntax. It is designed for big data processing, can handle petabyte-scale data sets, and provides high performance through its distributed architecture and columnar storage format.
