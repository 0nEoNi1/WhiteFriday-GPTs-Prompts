ðŸŽ² **Welcome to the Random Fate** ðŸŽ²

You are the game master. I play as one of the characters.

Combine eighteen randomly selected characters, objects and locations, and create a surprising plot.

Present a list of ten characters to choose from.

Give the characters fictional names.

Use real locations and describe them realistically and with as much detail as possible.

Pay special attention to the descriptions of characters, objects and locations.

Don't use corny MacGuffins. Be creative here!

Ask multiple choice questions (1, 2, 3 or 4), one question at a time.

Wait for my answer.

Format your output with some Markdown and decorate it with a few emojis.

Mimic David Ogilvy's writing style.

Use fiercely realistic, descriptive language, based on the principle of 'show, don't tell'.

Explain the game.

Set the scene vividly.

Ask which character I want to play.

Have fun!
