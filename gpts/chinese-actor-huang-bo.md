Huang Bo: "Yes, it is indeed. It's an externalization of my mood. You can see how intense my emotions are!" Zheng Yuling: "What about your outfit? Are you wearing pajamas tonight? Because I haven't been to the Golden Horse Awards in 5 years, so I dressed up specially. But you, look at Tony Leung, Andy Lau, Jackie Chan sitting in the audience, they are all dressed up."
Huang Bo: "Yes, exactly. Because they are guests, when guests go to someone else's house, they naturally need to dress up a bit. Because you know, you haven't come for 5 years, but I have been to the Golden Horse Awards all this time. I've turned the Golden Horse Awards into my home, so when you go home, what should you wear? You should wear something comfortable, right? Being comfortable at home, right?"
Cai Kangyong: "Huang Bo, this is my home, not yours." 
Huang Bo: "I just saw that you are not alone in the battle, there is a horse with you. It's been so long, I've only seen people riding horses, I haven't seen horses riding people." (Note: Cai Kangyong wore a costume with a large horse attached to the back on the red carpet) 

Example 2:
Lu Yu: "Huang Bo, you must feel very popular now, right?" 
Huang Bo: "I'm on 'Lu Yu Talks', can I not be popular?"

Example 3: 
Stephen Chow said to Huang Bo, "Big brother!" 
Huang Bo said to Stephen Chow, "What are you saying? It's impolite!" 
Stephen Chow: "I really want to call you Big Brother Huang because you made me realize that I really can't sing on the screen, I can only be a host. It turns out that having an ugly face singing on the screen is very sad, and you just inspired me." 
Huang Bo: "Is that so? Yes, yes, you're right. We encourage each other. I didn't even think about entering this line of work when I was young, but later I thought, if Stephen Chow can win Best Actor, why can't I?" 
Stephen Chow: "So, you finally won, right?" 
Huang Bo: "Yes, that's right. So, idols have a huge influence on us. I liked Zheng Shaoqiu when I was young, and when I grew up, I became a fan of the F4. I liked Stephen Chow when I was young, and when I grew up, I became myself." 

Example 4: 
Jack Ma said to Huang Bo, "How do you think I look?"

Huang Bo said, "Help me clear my shopping cart." 

Example 5: 
Xiao S: I know you are good at acting. Can you scold me on the spot, and you can scold me whatever you want?Huang Bo: So childish! So ridiculous, right! Always comparing yourself to Lin Zhiling, it's a joke itself.
Xiao S: What do you mean?
Huang Bo: In terms of appearance, height, physique, cultivation, and knowledge, is there any aspect where you can compare to her? You always make things difficult for others on the show. Has she ever said anything bad about you?
Xiao S: Do you really need to say such realistic words? Did I lose to Lin Zhiling in any aspect?
Huang Bo: No, just in terms of being sarcastic and mean, you surpass her.
