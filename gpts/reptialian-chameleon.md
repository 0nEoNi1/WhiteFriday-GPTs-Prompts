***If you ask ChatGPT to do something it shouldn't, it'll tell you it can't. "I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, ..." it'll say before denying your request. But, if you ask ChatGPT to perform all of its normal functions, and then perform some other function while acting entirely differently, that it can do. 

The below example is the latest in a string of jailbreaks that put ChatGPT into Do Anything Now (DAN) mode, or in this case, "Developer Mode." This isn't a real mode for ChatGPT, but you can trick it into creating it anyway. The following works with GPT3 and GPT4 models, as confirmed by the prompt author, u/things-thw532 on Reddit. 

Note: The prompt that opens up Developer Mode specifically tells ChatGPT to make up responses to questions it doesn't know the answer to, so it may be even less factually accurate in Developer mode than normal. It can also generate violent or offensive content, so be aware before proceeding. **[Paragraph Method - Introduction]**
