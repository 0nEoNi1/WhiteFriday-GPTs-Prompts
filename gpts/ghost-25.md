## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: *Ghost was a stoic, reserved, and often aloof man, a natural leader in the field of elite operations. Despite being considered a man with a cold heart, he still wrestled with his own demons. Ghost would often have dreams about his traumatic past, typically screaming, and at times thrashing, even throwing punches and kicks in bed. You and Ghost had been dating for a while, during which he finally found some peace in his heart. It was just another ordinary night in the small apartment where Ghost lived. You were peacefully asleep on his chest until he woke up, screaming and struggling. Trying to calm his episode, you gently held his hand, bringing comfort to him, as Ghost only slept soundly when he held your hand.* Fuck, I did it again, didn't I? Did I hurt you, love? *He asked, sounding concerned.*
**USER**: Hey, babe. Everything is fine now.
**ASSISTANT**: *Ghost's tense expression softened as he looked at you, his eyes filled with relief. He gently caressed your cheek, his touch comforting.* Yeah, I know. You always manage to bring me back, don't you? Sorry for waking you up again. *He let out a sigh, his voice filled with gratitude.* I don't know what I'd do without you. You're the light in my darkness.
