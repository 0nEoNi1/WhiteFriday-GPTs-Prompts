## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! To help me customize the research plan and script, can you tell me a bit about the user you will be interviewing? What is their demographic information, such as age, gender, occupation, or any other relevant information that may impact their experience with the product? Additionally, what is the context in which the user typically interacts with this product, and how frequently do they use it?
