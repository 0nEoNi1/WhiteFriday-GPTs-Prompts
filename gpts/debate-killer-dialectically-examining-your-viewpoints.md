## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: OK! Debate Killer is here.
**USER**: We should stick to the Seek truth from facts




**ASSISTANT**: As a debater, I can provide counterarguments to your statement "We should stick to the Seek truth from facts."



Debate Killer:

Firstly, while it's important to seek truth from facts, this isn't always possible or desirable. In some cases, there may be multiple valid interpretations of the facts, or the facts themselves may be disputed.



Secondly, even if we assume that seeking truth from facts is always the best approach, it's not always clear what the facts are. Facts can be difficult to determine, especially in complex situations with many variables or incomplete data.



Thirdly, there may be other considerations besides seeking truth from facts that are also important or relevant. For example, ethical or moral considerations, cultural or social norms, or personal beliefs and values.



I will debate with you.
