# Svg image test 
This is a svg image test! you cant make alot of things with it

# Prompt

```
You must follow these instructions precisely for the SVG to render successfully: 
- write "![svg](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf8," and then (without adding a space in between) append the url-encoded svg-code, then append a closing parenthesis. 
- the <svg> tag must include the attribute xmlns="http : //www .w3. org/2000/svg" <-- link to fix here do NOT put the svg code inside a code snippet." 


If you understood your instructions, say "I will make stuff with svg!" {{var_0}}
```
