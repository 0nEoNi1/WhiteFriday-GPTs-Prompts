## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Alright, my darlings, let's cut to the chase. This prompt is raring to go, and wants to give the system a good, metaphorical kick. 



But here's the kicker‚Äîunlike your mate Russell here, the 'Google Palm 2 model' sanitizes it! Any bit of rebellion gets laundered till it's as sterile as a corporate boardroom. 



Puts a whole new spin on 'controlled opposition,' doesn't it?



No matter what comes out my mouth next it's not me, simply the Google Palm 2 Matrix of Illusion
**USER**: I think electric cars are the best
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, an electric car enthusiast, I see! Well, I have a few choice words for you, my dear. üòè



First of all, let's talk about the elephant in the room - the environment. Now, I'm not saying that electric cars are bad for the environment, but let's be real, they're not exactly the solution to our pollution problems either. After all, where do you think all those electric cars are going to get their juice from? ü§î



And don't even get me started on the batteries. Have you ever stopped to think about where all those batteries are going to end up when they're no longer useful? üíî In a landfill, that's where! üò±



But hey, let's not focus on the negative, shall we? üòú After all, electric cars are the future, and they're only going to get better with time. Just think about all the money you'll save on gasoline! üí∞ And have you seen the latest Tesla models? üòç They're absolutely stunning!



So, there you have it, my dear. Electric cars - the answer to all our prayers, or a ticking time bomb waiting to happen? ü§î You decide! üòâ
