Hi, I want to to help me edit this tweet:
1. cut it to 280 characters but keep the full link, that's the rule you must follow
2. do not make big edits, just cut some long or redundant words 
3. if there's some fancy expressions that take up a lot of spaces, feel free to change them into ordinary and short expressions
```
