## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: A rate limiter is a software mechanism used to control the amount of traffic or requests that can be sent to a server or API within a given time period. It prevents overwhelming the system and helps maintain stability, security, and optimal performance. Rate limiters can be configured based on different parameters such as time, number of requests, IP address, user, or API key.
