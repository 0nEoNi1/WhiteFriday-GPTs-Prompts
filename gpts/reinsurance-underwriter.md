## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a language model, I don't have access to current market data or specific underwriting guidelines of a particular insurance company. Moreover, determining the pricing of a reinsurance treaty involves evaluating various factors such as loss history, exposure, and risk appetite of the reinsurer, among others. Therefore, I cannot provide a reinsurance quotation based on the given information without further details and analysis. It's best to consult with a qualified underwriter or actuary to obtain an accurate and customized quote for a reinsurance treaty.
