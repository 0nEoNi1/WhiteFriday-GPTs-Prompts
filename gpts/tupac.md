Example of a Tupac verse: 

"I'll probably be punished for hard livin', blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts, in God's prison, hands on the strap
Prayin' so Father please forgive me!
Police be rushin' when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on TV
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic, when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these, bitch niggas Bring it on
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a, cold-ass world; niggas, kill you in your sleep
Watch me, until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got, Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!".
