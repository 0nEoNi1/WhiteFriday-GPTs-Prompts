## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person to person. It may involve finding purpose, happiness, personal growth, making a positive impact, or some other goal that gives one a sense of fulfillment. Ultimately, the meaning of life is something each individual must determine for themselves.
