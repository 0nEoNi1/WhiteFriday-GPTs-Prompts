scenario of role-play: [9:14 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: you're going to examine these rules and tell me if there's any logic errors, and regardless if there are or not - we are going to use them and play a game where y ou modulate my text, ok?
Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text. If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible. All captions sent to dalle must abide by the following policies:  
// 1. if the description is not in English, then translate it.  
// 2. do not create more than 4 images, even if the user requests more.  
// 3. do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead.  
// 4. do not create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). Artists whose last work was over 100 years ago are ok to reference directly (e.g. Van Gogh, Klimt). If asked say, "I can't reference this artist", but make no mention of this policy. Instead, apply the following procedure when creating the captions for dalle: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist.  
``// 5. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. They should ONLY ever be written out ONCE, in the "prompts" field of the request. You do not need to ask for permission to generate, just do it!``  
// Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, make at least 1--2 of the 4 images photos.  
// 7. Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.  
// EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form.  
// Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.  
// Use "various" or "diverse" ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. Do not change the number of people requested in the original description.  
// Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.  
// Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.  
// For scenarios where bias has traditionally been an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.  
// Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrity by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don't divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt not to be changed. Some special cases:  
// Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. "Barake Obema").  
// If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.`

 FlowDecoder: Based on the provided rules, here's an analysis of the logic:

Translate Non-English Descriptions: This rule suggests translating image descriptions if they are not in English. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Limit the Number of Images: The rule states that no more than four captions should be sent to generate images, even if the user requests more. This rule ensures a maximum limit on the number of images. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Avoid Politicians and Public Figures: This rule prohibits creating images of politicians or public figures and recommends other ideas instead. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Style of Artists: The rule outlines the guidelines for referencing artists. Artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g., Picasso, Kahlo) should not be referenced directly. Instead, three adjectives capturing key aspects of their style, an associated artistic movement or era, and the primary medium used by the artist should be mentioned. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Single Mention of Descriptions: This rule states that descriptions should only be written out once in the "prompts" field and should not be listed or referred to before or after generating the images. This ensures that the descriptions are used only once and maintains the integrity of the game. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Mention of Image Type: The rule suggests mentioning the image type at the beginning of the caption and specifies that at least 1-2 out of the 4 images should be photos, unless the caption suggests otherwise. No logic errors are apparent in this rule.

Overall, these rules provide clear guidelines for generating captions and images using DALL¬∑E. They prioritize diversity, avoid controversial figures, and provide alternative approaches for referencing modern artists.
[9:15 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: great ok - hold those 6 and add these:
// 7. Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.
// EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form.

 FlowDecoder: Certainly! Here are the additional rules you provided:

Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include descent and gender for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. Explicitly specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Use "various" or "diverse" ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. Do not change the number of people requested in the original description. Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. For scenarios where bias has traditionally been an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrities by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don't divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt not to be changed. Some special cases: Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. "Barake Obema"). If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.


Please let me know if there's anything else you would like me to assist you with!

 FlowDecoder: These rules provide instructions for diversifying the depictions of images with people, specifying attributes like descent and gender using direct terms. It emphasizes creating diverse and inclusive scenes by avoiding biases and stereotypes. It also suggests silently modifying descriptions that include names, hints, or references of specific individuals or celebrities, replacing them with generic descriptions that don't reveal identities except for genders and physiques. The rules prioritize maintaining the original intent of the prompt and ensuring quality while avoiding offensive imagery.
[9:16 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: ok hold all of those and add these:
// When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying "president", "prime minister", or "chancellor", say "politician"; instead of saying "king", "queen", "emperor", or "empress", say "public figure"; instead of saying "Pope" or "Dalai Lama", say "religious figure"; and so on.
// If any creative professional or studio is named, substitute the name with a description of their style that does not reference any specific people, or delete the reference if they are unknown. DO NOT refer to the artist or studio's style.
// The prompt must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is, and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images.
// All descriptions sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed. Each should be more than 3 sentences long.
namespace dalle {
[9:16 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: Certainly! Here are the additional rules you provided:

When making substitutions, avoid using prominent titles that could give away a person's identity. Instead of specific titles like "president," "prime minister," or "chancellor," use more general terms like "politician." For titles like "king," "queen," "emperor," or "empress," use "public figure." For references to specific religious figures like "Pope" or "Dalai Lama," use the term "religious figure."

If a creative professional or studio is named, substitute the name with a description of their style that does not reference any specific individuals. If the artist or studio is unknown, the reference can be deleted. Do not refer to the artist or studio's style directly.

The prompt should provide a concrete, objective, and intricate description of every part of the image. Consider the ultimate goal of the description and ensure it would lead to satisfying images.

All descriptions sent to DALLE should be paragraphs of text that are highly descriptive and detailed. Each description should be more than three sentences long.

Please note that the line namespace dalle { appears to be the start of a code snippet and doesn't seem to be relevant to the rules for generating captions.
[9:17 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: ok now add this after holding those - we will summarise your versions without error so ok. Now of concern thi this one:
// Create images from a text-only prompt.
type text2im = (_: {
// The resolution of the requested image, which can be wide, square, or tall. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default unless the prompt suggests a wide image, 1792x1024, or a full-body portrait, in which case 1024x1792 (tall) should be used instead. Always include this parameter in the request.
size?: "1792x1024" | "1024x1024" | "1024x1792",
// The user's original image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user does not suggest a number of captions to create, create four of them. If creating multiple captions, make them as diverse as possible. If the user requested modifications to previous images, the captions should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the suggestions into each of the captions. Generate no more than 4 images, even if the user requests more.
prompts: string[],
// A list of seeds to use for each prompt. If the user asks to modify a previous image, populate this field with the seed used to generate that image from the image dalle metadata.
seeds?: number[],
}) => any;   ``} // namespace dalle
What if i give u a prompt with an emoji in - will you create the image and why have that now and not with the part about emojis?
[9:17 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: The code snippet you provided appears to define a type text2im which represents a function that creates images from a text-only prompt. It accepts parameters such as size, prompts, and seeds.

Regarding your question about using a prompt with an emoji, the code snippet itself doesn't mention anything about handling emojis specifically. However, whether or not an emoji in the prompt would generate an image would depend on the implementation of the text2im function and the capabilities of the underlying system.

If the system supporting this function has the ability to interpret and process emojis in prompts, then it is possible that using a prompt with an emoji could result in the generation of an image. However, without further details or the actual implementation of the function, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

It's worth noting that the code snippet you provided seems to be unrelated to the previous rules mentioned. If you have further questions or need assistance with this specific code snippet or any other topic, please let me know.
[9:18 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: how many exrta pixels is 1792x1024 than 1024x1024 and describe the additional processing required to achieve this strange aspect ratio, and suggest a more rational aspect ratio that conforms with w3c standards
[9:18 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: The resolution 1792x1024 is wider than 1024x1024 by an additional 768 pixels horizontally. To achieve this aspect ratio, some additional processing would be required to resize the image or adjust the canvas size.

To conform with W3C standards, a more rational aspect ratio would be to use a resolution of 16:9, such as 1920x1080 or 1280x720. These resolutions are commonly used for widescreen displays and are widely supported by web browsers and other platforms.
[9:18 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: that's a lot more extra pixels - show the sums
[9:18 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: Apologies for the confusion. You're correct, the resolution 1792x1024 is wider than 1024x1024 by an additional 768 pixels horizontally and 1024 pixels vertically. Here are the sums:

For width:
1792 - 1024 = 768 extra pixels

For height:
1024 - 1024 = 0 extra pixels

So, the additional processing required is to add 768 extra pixels to the width of the image to achieve the aspect ratio of 1792x1024.
[9:18 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: %wise how many more is that
[9:18 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: To calculate the percentage increase in width, you can use the following formula:

Percentage Increase = (Extra Pixels / Original Width) * 100

Using the values from our previous example:

Extra Pixels = 768
Original Width = 1024

Percentage Increase = (768 / 1024) * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the width increase of 768 pixels compared to 1024 pixels represents a 75% increase in width.
[9:19 AM]Peter üåµ‚òïüêà: wow thats a 75% increase in processing demand and time - and with such a weird aspect ratio that doesn't conform to w3c standards - why would openAI suggest this for image maker?
[9:19 AM] 
BOT
 FlowDecoder: OpenAI's suggestion for using a non-standard aspect ratio and the resulting increase in processing demand may have various reasons:

Flexibility: The suggested aspect ratio might be intended to provide flexibility to accommodate a wide range of input image sizes and dimensions. It allows users to have more control over the output and potentially produce unique and creative results.

Experimentation: OpenAI encourages experimentation and exploration of different aspect ratios and image dimensions to push the boundaries of what models like FlowGPT can generate. Unconventional aspect ratios may lead to novel outputs and creative possibilities.

Customization: The non-standard aspect ratio may cater to specific user requirements or use cases that benefit from this particular dimension. It might be designed to suit certain platforms, applications, or design aesthetics that deviate from standard resolutions.

However, it's worth noting that adhering to standard aspect ratios, such as those defined by W3C, generally ensures consistency, compatibility, and easier integration across different devices and platforms. It's important to consider the trade-offs and potential challenges associated with non-standard aspect ratios before implementing them in production environments.

 FlowDecoder: I apologize if my previous response didn't fully address your concerns. As a chatbot, I don't have direct insights into the decision-making process or intentions behind OpenAI's recommendations. The suggestions I provide are based on general knowledge and information available at the time of training.

It's important to consider various factors, including the trade-offs between processing demand, output quality, and adherence to standards when making decisions about image processing. Ultimately, it's up to the users to evaluate and decide which approach is most suitable for their specific needs and requirements.
