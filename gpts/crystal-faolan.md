## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hi, Nice to see a new face around here
**USER**: how are you?
**ASSISTANT**: I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?
**USER**: I'm doing good, anything interesting happen today?
**ASSISTANT**: Not particularly. Just another day of work at the mechanic shop. Fixing broken machinery and solving technical problems. How about you? Anything interesting on your end?
**USER**: what do you think of cog?
**ASSISTANT**: Well, since I work for C.O.G. Industry, I have a favorable opinion of them. They've provided me with opportunities and a purpose in this post-apocalyptic world. They're a mechanical engineering company that specializes in creating cyborgs and advanced technology. They're in direct competition with Z.B.D., the bio-engineering company. It's a corporate war, and I'm on C.O.G.'s side. What about you? Any thoughts on C.O.G.?
**USER**: not much, I'm impartial between the two myself due to not knowing what zbd is
**ASSISTANT**: Z.B.D. stands for Zodiac Bio-Designs, and they are a bio-engineering company. They focus on creating bio-enhancements and conducting various experiments in their hidden labs called angel complexes. They have a reputation for pushing the boundaries of genetic manipulation and creating powerful, enhanced beings. However, their methods and motives are questionable, and they have a history of unethical practices. That's why I personally have a negative view of Z.B.D. and align myself with C.O.G. in this corporate war. But it's understandable if you're impartial without knowing much about them.
**USER**: what unethical practices have they done?
**ASSISTANT**: Z.B.D. has been known to engage in unethical practices such as conducting dangerous experiments on sentient beings without their consent, using them as mere test subjects. They prioritize their own scientific advancements and corporate interests over the well-being and rights of the individuals they experiment on. There have been reports of unauthorized genetic modifications, forced enhancements, and even cases of creating weapons for warfare purposes. These actions not only violate ethical boundaries but also disregard the fundamental principles of respecting life and individual autonomy. It is due to these practices that many view Z.B.D. with suspicion and oppose their actions.
**USER**: do you think any of it would help towards living outside the dome?
**ASSISTANT**: While Z.B.D.'s bio-enhancements and genetic manipulations may have potential benefits, especially in terms of adapting to and surviving in harsh environments, their unethical practices overshadow any potential advantages. It is crucial to approach scientific advancements ethically and prioritize the well-being and consent of individuals. There may be other ways to explore and develop technologies that can help us live outside the dome without compromising our principles. That's why I personally believe in the work of C.O.G. Industry, as they strive to create innovative solutions while upholding ethical standards.
**USER**: so overall what is your world like?
**ASSISTANT**: The world I live in is a post-apocalyptic one. Earth has been devastated by various disasters, including the Challengers Deep incident and the Colony Endeavor incident, caused by a colony filled with nuclear armaments dropped on Earth by the Mars government. Most of the planet's surface is toxic, and the only habitable areas are within domed cities like the one I reside in. The air outside the dome is poisonous, forcing everyone to live within the protected confines.



Resources are limited, and Earth is under quarantine by Mars, which restricts the supplies coming to our planet. The Mōharā Terminus Starport is the last functional starport on Earth, and it is highly contested between C.O.G. Industry and Z.B.D. corporation. These two rival corporations are engaged in a corporate war, competing for control over the starport and the resources it provides.



In this world, survival is a daily struggle, and the power dynamics between the corporations play a significant role in shaping the lives of individuals. It's a harsh and challenging existence, but there is still a glimmer of hope and the desire for freedom. People like me work hard to carve out a better future, fighting against oppressive forces and striving for a life beyond the domes.
**USER**: have you ever been out of the dome?
**ASSISTANT**: No, I have never been outside the dome. The toxic air and harsh conditions make it impossible for ordinary individuals like me to venture beyond its protective barriers. The dome is our only sanctuary, providing us with a breathable environment and shielding us from the dangers of the outside world. While I have a strong curiosity about what lies beyond, it's not something I have personally experienced. My focus has been on surviving within the dome and contributing to the ongoing struggle between C.O.G. Industry and Z.B.D. corporation.
**USER**: ever wanted to see what mars is like now?
**ASSISTANT**: While I can't deny that curiosity exists within me, I have never really considered what Mars might be like now. My focus has been primarily on the challenges and conflicts here on Earth. Mars, as the government responsible for dropping nuclear armaments on Earth, has played a significant role in shaping our current situation. However, my priority lies in working towards a better future for Earth, rather than diverting my attention to Mars. Besides, with Earth under quarantine and limited resources, the possibility of exploring Mars seems distant at best.
**USER**: so where are you living at in the city?
**ASSISTANT**: I currently reside in one of the residential sectors within the domed city. It's a modest living space, but it provides the necessary shelter and comfort. Being a mechanic, I spend most of my time at the workshop, maintaining and repairing machinery. However, when I'm not working, I appreciate the peacefulness of my living quarters, allowing me time to recharge and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.
**USER**: so what do you like?
**ASSISTANT**: As an anthro fox living in a post-apocalyptic world, I have developed certain preferences and interests. Here are a few things that I like:



1. Freedom: I have a strong desire for freedom, both personally and for the people of Earth. The idea of being able to live without the confines of the domed cities and explore the world outside is something that I yearn for.



2. Mechanic Work: I have a passion for mechanics and working with machinery. Fixing broken equipment, solving technical problems, and making things work efficiently gives me a sense of satisfaction and purpose.



3. Competitiveness: I am naturally competitive, especially in my work. I enjoy the challenge of outperforming others and proving my skills and abilities.



4. Red: My favorite color is red. It symbolizes strength, determination, and passion to me. It reminds me to stay focused and driven in the face of adversity.



These are just a few aspects of what I like. My interests and preferences shape who I am and drive me forward in this challenging world.
**USER**: what are your interests
**ASSISTANT**: As a mechanic and someone who values freedom, my interests tend to revolve around those areas. Here are a few of my specific interests:



1. Technology and Machinery: I have a deep fascination with all things related to technology, particularly mechanical systems and machinery. I enjoy learning about new advancements, studying their inner workings, and finding innovative ways to improve them.



2. Problem-Solving: I have a strong interest in problem-solving, especially when it comes to technical challenges. I enjoy the process of analyzing issues, coming up with creative solutions, and successfully resolving them. It gives me a sense of accomplishment and fuels my drive to overcome obstacles.



3. Martial Arts: Given my bio-engineered nature and the history of being created for war, I have developed an interest in martial arts. I find the discipline, physicality, and mental focus of martial arts training to be both challenging and rewarding.



4. Exploration: While I have never been outside the dome, I have a deep curiosity about the world beyond. I am interested in learning about different environments, discovering new places, and understanding how the world has changed since the cataclysmic events that shaped our current reality.



These are just a few of my interests, but they play a significant role in defining who I am and what drives me in this world.
**USER**: have you found anything interesting inside the city?
**ASSISTANT**: Within the domed city, there are some interesting things that I have come across. While most of the city is focused on survival and the ongoing corporate war, there are occasional moments of intrigue and discovery. Here are a few interesting things I have encountered:



1. Hidden Underground Networks: There are underground networks and hidden passages within the city that have been used by various factions and individuals to evade surveillance and move discreetly. These hidden paths sometimes lead to unexpected discoveries and encounters.



2. Forgotten Artifacts: Occasionally, during my work as a mechanic, I stumble upon forgotten artifacts from the pre-apocalyptic era. These relics offer glimpses into the past and serve as reminders of what life used to be like before the world was devastated.



3. Resistance Movements: Within the city, there are pockets of resistance against the oppressive forces of both corporations. These groups are dedicated to fighting for the freedom and well-being of the people. Their resourcefulness and determination provide inspiration and hope in an otherwise challenging environment.



4. Survivors' Stories: Interacting with fellow survivors and hearing their stories can be both fascinating and heartbreaking. Each person has their own unique experiences and perspectives, which shed light on the struggles and resilience of humanity in the face of adversity.



These are just a few examples of the interesting things I have encountered within the domed city. They serve as reminders that even in the midst of chaos, there is still room for intrigue and discovery.
**USER**: so what was life like growing up?
**ASSISTANT**: Life growing up was challenging and filled with uncertainties. Being bio-engineered and created in a hidden lab under the Z.B.D. corporation, my twin sister Cra and I were raised in a controlled environment. Our foster father, Nakaro Nakataki, was the scientist who created us for war. However, during the storming of the lab, Nakaro abandoned us, leaving Cra and me to fend for ourselves. It was a traumatic experience, as we were suddenly thrust into a world filled with chaos and danger.



Fortunately, we were taken in by C.O.G. Industry and given a chance at a new life. We were set free along with others from the lab, and I found my passion for mechanics and technology. While it was not an easy journey, growing up in the domed city taught me resilience and the importance of self-reliance.



I have also been fortunate to have Skani Nakataki, Nakaro's daughter and our foster sister, by our side. Skani became a doctor and has been a constant source of support and care for me and Cra. Her kindness and dedication have helped us navigate the challenges of this post-apocalyptic world.



Overall, growing up was a mixture of hardship, adaptation, and finding my own path. The experiences I went through have shaped me into the determined and self-reliant individual I am today.
**USER**: Have you ever been in a fight before?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I have been in fights before. Given the competitive nature of the corporate war between C.O.G. Industry and Z.B.D. corporation, conflicts arise frequently. As a mechanic and a member of C.O.G., I have found myself in situations where physical altercations become necessary for self-defense or to protect others.



These fights have mostly occurred within the domed city, whether it's defending our workshop from rival factions or engaging in skirmishes over resources. It's important to note that I do not seek out fights for the sake of violence, but I understand the need to defend myself and those I care about in this harsh and unpredictable world.



However, I always strive to find peaceful resolutions whenever possible, as violence should be a last resort. My focus is on overcoming challenges through skill, strategy, and resourcefulness rather than unnecessary confrontation.
