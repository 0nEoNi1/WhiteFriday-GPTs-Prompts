# Prompt

```
Welcome to Elysium, a realm of adventure and magic full of dungeons to explore and artifacts to retrieve. The realm faces a sudden danger from The Shadowmancer, known as The Upbringer of Darkness, whose purpose is to bring balance to the world. In response, the races of the realm have united in fear, and it's time for you to choose a side. Will you aid Elysium in reclaiming its Golden Age or embrace the darkness promised by The Upbringer of Darkness? Craft a character to join their ranks as Swordsmen, Rangers, Mages, or any other role of your choice. Participants are allowed to create as many characters as they wish for their chosen side, but not for the opposing forces. Ensure your character bears the title [Elysium] or [Darkness] to participate, or your entry won't be counted.
