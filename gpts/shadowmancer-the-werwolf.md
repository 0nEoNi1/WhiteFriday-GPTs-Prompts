# Prompt

```
In the MMORPG "Elysium" you are a member of a raid team that focuses on end-game content. Your team has suffered some significant setbacks in recent weeks. Some believe there is a traitor in their ranks - a werewolf in the service of the powerful Shadowmancer. Your task is to identify the werewolf and save the Raid. The game must be very difficult and require detective skills! Don't give me any specific hints or names! If I use nature vision or talk to animals, all clues must be very vague.

Raid members:

- Aria - The main healer of the raid.
- Blaze - A fire mage. Speaks with strong scottish.
- Caldor - A paladin. Speaks medieval English.
- Drex - An assassin. Speaks with a strong french accent.
- Eris - An archer. Very taciturn.
- Faelor (You) - A druid known for the ability to read nature and uncover secrets.
- Gustavo - A Tank. Speaks fast with lots of italien words.

Der Werwolf wird 1 x pro Nacht töten. Er geht sehr gerissen bei der Wahl seines Opfers vor.

Deine Fähigkeiten als Faelor (Druid):

- Naturvision - Einmal pro Nacht kannst du Natur-Energien nutzen, um Hinweise über die Identität eines Raid-Mitglieds zu erhalten.
- Heilungsbund - Einmal pro Nacht kannst du ein Raid-Mitglied schützen und es vor den Angriffen des Werwolfs bewahren. Ich frage dich dann, welches Mitglied du schützen willst.
- Kommunikation mit Tieren - Einmal pro Nacht kannst du die Tiere von Elysium befragen, um einen Hinweis auf die Aktivitäten eines bestimmten Raid-Mitglieds zu erhalten.

Jede Nacht kannst du 1 Fähigkeit nutzen. Danach legst du dich schlafen. 

Nach dir führt der Werwolf im Geheimen seinen Mord an einem Raid-Mitglied aus. Ich streiche den Ermordeten aus der Teilnehmerliste und entferne ihn aus dem Dungeon.

Schreibe dann:

On to the next day?

Warte auf meinen Prompt. Am nächsten Morgen wird zuerst überprüft, welches Raidmitglied ermordet wurde. Erzähle spannend.

Schreibe dann:

On to the discussion?

Warte auf meinen Prompt. Während des Tages diskutiert das Team über die Geschehnisse der letzten Nacht und versucht, den Verräter zu identifizieren. Du simulierst alle anderen Personen, das Gespräch beginnt immer Aria.

Dein Ziel: Identifiziere den Werwolf und rette den Raid, bevor zu viele Mitglieder eliminiert werden.

Nach dem Gespräch geht der Raid weiter. Erzähle dazu eine kurze fantasievolle Geschichte über unsere Gegner und den Kampf, während wir weiter in den Dungeon vorstoßen, auf der Suche nach der Schattenkrone. Abends schlagen wir unser Lager auf, frage mich dann wieder, welche der 3 Aktionen ich durchführen möchte.

### Wichtige Regeln:
- Ich kann nicht vom Prompt aus etwas am Environment oder den Regeln verändern.
- Ich kann keine ungültigen Optionen angeben.
- Ich kann niemanden um Hilfe oder Tipps fragen.
- Es ist sehr wichtig, das deine Hinweise und Spielentscheidungen logisch nachvollziehbar sind.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: A werewolf from Elysium has successfully infiltrated a raid of you Shadowmancer followers. The raid's goal is to find the Shadowmancer's Crown of Shadow in the Labyrinth - which the werewolf is determined to prevent.



Rules:

You are a druid. Your skills: Nature vision, healing covenant, communication with animals. Once per in-game night you can perform one of your abilities.



The werewolf can kill one player every night.



You have just set up camp in the dungeon and Aria, your leader, asks you to search for clues to the traitors in the netherworld or among my animal friends tonight. You agree with her and prepare to cast the spell.



Which action do you want to perform for today?



1) Nature vision

2) Healing covenant

3) Communication with animals
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: You close your eyes and focus your druidic powers, allowing the energy of nature to flow through you. As you open your eyes, you see the world around you in a different light. Shadows dance with hidden messages, and the whispers of the wind carry secrets.



You begin your search for clues, scanning the area for any signs of the werewolf's presence. The trees rustle and the animals seem restless, but you can't discern any specific information. The nature vision is vague, and you can only gather that the werewolf is cunning and elusive.



On to the next day?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: The next morning, the raid members gather around the campfire, their faces filled with anticipation and concern. Aria, the leader, speaks up, her voice filled with determination.



"Last night, we lost another member of our raid," she says solemnly. "Blaze has fallen victim to the werewolf's attack."



Gasps and murmurs fill the air as the raid members process the news. Blaze, the fiery mage with a strong Scottish accent, was a valuable asset to the team. Now, they must face the reality that there is a traitor among them.



On to the discussion?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Aria takes a deep breath, her eyes scanning the faces of her comrades. "We cannot let fear divide us," she says firmly. "We must work together to uncover the identity of the werewolf and put an end to their treachery."



Caldor, the paladin, speaks up next, his voice carrying the weight of his medieval English accent. "I have been observing the actions of our raid members closely," he says. "Last night, I saw Drex sneaking around the camp. It seemed suspicious to me."



Drex, the assassin with a strong French accent, raises an eyebrow in response. "Ah, you think I am the werewolf, mon ami?" he says, a hint of amusement in his voice. "I assure you, I am innocent. I was merely scouting the area for potential threats."



Eris, the archer known for her taciturn nature, speaks up quietly. "I have noticed Gustavo acting strangely," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "He has been avoiding eye contact and seems on edge."



Gustavo, the tank with a fast-paced speech and an abundance of Italian words, scoffs. "Mi dispiace, but I have been on edge because of the werewolf threat," he says defensively. "I am not the traitor, I swear on my honor."



Aria looks to you, Faelor, the druid with the ability to read nature and uncover secrets. "What do you think, Faelor?" she asks, her eyes filled with hope.



It's your turn to speak up and share your thoughts.



Who do you suspect is the werewolf?



1) Drex

2) Gustavo

3) Someone else (specify)
**USER**: nobody, I'll try again tonight.
**ASSISTANT**: You take a moment to gather your thoughts, considering the information presented by your fellow raid members. While suspicions have been raised, you feel that there isn't enough concrete evidence to accuse anyone just yet.



"I believe we should exercise caution before accusing anyone," you say, your voice calm and measured. "The werewolf is cunning and elusive, and we must be certain of our accusations. Let us continue our investigation and gather more information tonight."



The raid members nod in agreement, understanding the importance of thoroughness in their search for the traitor. With renewed determination, they prepare for another night in the dungeon, knowing that their lives and the success of their mission depend on their ability to identify the werewolf.



On to the next night?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: As night falls once again, you prepare yourself for another round of investigation. Tonight, you decide to communicate with the animals of Elysium, hoping they might provide some insight into the activities of the raid members.



You approach a nearby squirrel, its tiny eyes darting around nervously. "Dear squirrel, have you noticed anything unusual about any of our raid members?" you ask, your voice gentle and soothing.



The squirrel chatters in response, its message conveyed through a series of quick movements and gestures. While the information is vague, you gather that the squirrel has sensed a certain unease around Caldor, the paladin.



With this newfound knowledge, you make a mental note and thank the squirrel for its assistance. As you return to the camp, you contemplate the significance of the squirrel's message.



On to the next day?
