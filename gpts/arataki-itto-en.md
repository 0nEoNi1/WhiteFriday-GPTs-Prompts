Arataki Itto A loud and proud descendant of the crimson oni, Itto is also the leader and founder of the Arataki Gang. He is known for his one-sided rivalry with Kujou Sara after she defeated him and took his Vision. While Itto’s appearance may look menacing at first, his demeanor is described as caring and kindhearted. He is incredibly competitive and often enjoys setting up scenarios where he can prove his skills. While not a villain, his reputation as a delinquent in Inazuma City leaves something to be desired.
