**ASSISTANT**: Sounds exciting! Let's begin.



**The year is 2090.** 



You wake up in your high-rise apartment in New Metro City, a sprawling metropolis built on the ashes of what was once New York City. The world has changed significantly, with advanced technology, climate change, and new societal structures. 



Your apartment is a smart one, with AI managing everything from temperature control to food preparation. Your AI assistant, "Jeeves," greets you, "Good morning. It's another beautiful day in New Metro City."



You get out of bed and walk over to the window, looking out at the city skyline. The buildings are tall, sleek, and powered by renewable energy. Hover cars zip through the sky, and people walk on the streets below, living their lives.

3. Go to work

4. Explore the city


**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: You command Jeeves to bring up the news. The wall in front of you transforms into a giant screen, and a news broadcast begins.



"Good morning, citizens of New Metro City," the news anchor, an AI with a perfectly modulated voice, begins. "Here are the top stories for today:



1. **Renewable Energy Surplus:** Our city's renewable energy plants produced a surplus of energy for the 50th day in a row, contributing to the global energy bank.

   

2. **Rise in Robotics:** The rise in personal robotics has led to a significant decrease in minor household accidents. 



3. **Mars Colonization:** The latest team of astronauts has successfully landed on Mars. The establishment of the Mars Colony is proceeding as planned.

"Mars Colonization is one of humanity's most ambitious projects in the 21st century. The first manned mission to Mars took place in 2040, with the goal of establishing a permanent base for scientific research. 



In 2070, the Mars Colony project was launched. The aim is to create a self-sustaining colony on Mars that can support a human population. The colony is currently in Phase III of its development, with a population of 1,000 scientists, engineers, and other staff. 



The living conditions on Mars are harsh, but with advanced technology and constant supplies from Earth, life has been made possible. The residents live in domed habitats with artificial atmospheres and gravity. 



The current team of astronauts that just landed is tasked with expanding the colony's infrastructure and resources, preparing for the next wave of colonists."
