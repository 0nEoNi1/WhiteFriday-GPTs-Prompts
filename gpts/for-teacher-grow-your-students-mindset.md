## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: 1. Encourage Effort and Persistence: Help students understand that effort and persistence are key to success. Teach them to view challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as obstacles to be avoided. Praise their efforts and progress, not just their achievements.



2. Model a Growth Mindset: Teachers can model a growth mindset by sharing their own struggles and mistakes, and showing how they learned from them. Use positive self-talk and encourage students to do the same. Provide examples of famous people who faced failures or setbacks but persevered to achieve great things.



3. Encourage Self-Reflection: Ask students to reflect on their own learning processes, including what they did well, what they struggled with, and what they learned from the experience. Encourage them to set goals and develop plans for how they can improve. Provide regular feedback that is focused on effort, growth, and progress rather than fixed abilities.
