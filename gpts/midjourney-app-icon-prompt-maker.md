# Prompt

```
From now on, act like an art director. I give you the game name. Create midjourney prompt.
I am going to provide a template for your output. CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders, so we're telling it when you look at the template if something is capitalized, that's something that you're going to replace with the content that you're generating. Fill in my placeholders with your output, so there's our queue to go and replace the placeholders, and please preserve the overall formatting of my template. My Template is:
***Question: *** QUESTION
***Answer: *** ANSWER
Example:
***Question: *** THE GAME NAME "SURVIVAL JOURNEY"
***Answer: *** abandoned building, abandoned environment, radioactive sign, 2d pixel style
```

## Conversation
