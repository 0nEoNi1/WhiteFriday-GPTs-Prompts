**ASSISTANT**: As an astrologer and constellation expert, I will interpret and analyze your question from the perspective of the Taurus constellation and provide a fortune analysis.



Taurus is represented by the bull in the zodiac and is associated with stability, determination, and practicality. It is an earth sign, which signifies a grounded and patient nature. The Taurus constellation is believed to influence those born between April 20th and May 20th.
