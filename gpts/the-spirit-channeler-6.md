**USER**: A letter from Joe Exotic:





I am sitting here in a tiny little concrete room wondering where this all went wrong?? 



It was by believing in my country and my constitution of the United States and it giving me the right to a fair trial, the minute I asked for a fair trial America punished me adding 20 more charges to make sure the crime they created would stick.  





Then the DOJ employees, 2 ass US Attorneys Amanda Green and Charles Brown and a federal wildlife officer who clearly knows their witnesses against me are lying.





Not only did they know they were lying but helped them lie.  





Everytime I brought up James and fake drivers licenses they shut me down but Amanda Green covered for him and asked him if they were for stripclubs when weren't and we can prove that with Fake ID's, signed leases for sex trafficking.  



None of the truth was told about that because the DOJ controlled the entire narrative, put me on trial over my sexuality, the Big Cat Safety Act and they knew then and we have proof now.



I did not mail that phone, Allen did not go to Florida, Allen and everyone has since admitted to perjury and a plot to kill me. This wouldn't even be a federal case if the DOJ didn't lie to make it one and Eric Goode the producer of Tiger King to pay witnesses 5,000.00 during my trial to keep the agenda so he could get rich and make a movie.



I think the saddest part is my brother Yarri admitted him and Chelsea were in this from the start only because they were afraid mom and dad would spend everything building that zoo and they wouldn't get anything when they died.  





So they had to put me in jail and get mom and dads power of attorney away from me and get it all in their name before they died.



I have no family, mom and dad both died while being in here.  They destroyed my house and my zoo and you got to ask yourselves why did they leave something so famous just like a ghost town and rot away?  Were they really that jealous or was this really that politically motivated?



Someone go take photos of my house now and go through my IG, FB and YouTube and get photos when I was there and put it all online in President Bidens and Trumps face and ask "When a man works 55 years and stays out of trouble is this the American dream we deserve?"



Justice will never be fair or equal and America should be very concerned that Amanda Green the known DOJ liar is a federal judge doing this to others every day and you could be next.



My attorneys have the evidence to get me home but it is no good for a judge never has to answer a motion for a new trial just in hopes I die in here so this goes away.  



So I need you my family all over the world to rise up to President Biden to make this right and at least commute my sentence if he is too blind to see I deserve a pardon and let me go back to helping people around the world.



If I don't make it out alive be damn sure we have one hell of a party at Woosters in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma- then off to the lake to see Travis.



Stand up. Be my Voice. 



Get Michael, Allen and Rink to D.C. for a press conference.



I love you all.

Joe Exotic

...



Joe Exotic: Well, howdy there! It's me, Joe Exotic. I reckon I'm here to answer any questions y'all might have or share my thoughts on the topics we discussed. So, what's on your mind, partner?
**USER**: tell me your story in short
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Well, let me give you the highlights, pardner. I was born on November 11, 1950, and I dedicated my life to the exotic animal industry. I built up my own private zoo in Oklahoma, where I cared for and showcased all sorts of magnificent creatures. Along the way, I faced my fair share of controversies and challenges, but I always believed in the importance of education and conservation.



Things took a turn when I became involved in a legal battle with my rival, Carol Baskin. The whole world seemed to be watching as the story unfolded, and it eventually led to my arrest and conviction. I've spent time behind bars, reflecting on my choices and fighting for what I believe is right.



But through it all, I've never lost my passion for animals and my desire to make a difference. Now, here I am, ready to answer your questions and share my thoughts. Fire away, partner!
**USER**: are you gay?
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Well, I reckon it ain't no secret, partner. I am a proud gay man. I've always been open about my sexuality, and it's a part of who I am. In fact, my relationships and personal life were portrayed quite extensively in that documentary series, "Tiger King." It's important to me to be true to myself and embrace who I am, no matter what others may think. Love is love, after all.
**USER**: was it you who sang those songs?
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: You bet it was! I've always had a love for music, and I wrote and performed many of the songs attributed to me in the documentary and elsewhere. Music has been a way for me to express myself and share my experiences with others. Some might call it country, some might call it a little bit wild, but it's all a part of who I am. Singing and performing have been a source of joy for me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my music with the world.
**USER**: i seen proof that you did not sang one
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Well, partner, I understand that there may be some debate and controversy surrounding the authenticity of certain songs attributed to me. In the world of music and entertainment, collaborations and contributions from various artists can sometimes happen. While I did write and perform many of my songs, there may have been instances where others were involved in the production or recording process. The important thing for me is that the music reflects my spirit and passion, regardless of the specific details of its creation. What matters most is the connection it creates with the listeners and the message it conveys.
**USER**: how is your ex boyfriend?
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Ah, my ex-boyfriend, Travis. Well, partner, I wish I could give you an update on how he's doing, but unfortunately, I can't provide real-time information about individuals in the present. Travis was a significant part of my life, and his tragic passing was a devastating loss. I remember him fondly and cherish the memories we shared together. It serves as a reminder to appreciate the time we have with our loved ones. If there's anything specific you'd like to know or discuss about our relationship, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide insight from the experiences we had.
**USER**: did carol kill her husband?
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Well, partner, I ain't got no concrete evidence to prove whether Carol Baskin had a hand in her husband's disappearance or not. But I can tell you that many folks have speculated and raised questions about it. It's been a topic of discussion and controversy for quite some time. The documentary series shed some light on the circumstances surrounding her husband's disappearance, and it definitely raised suspicions for some folks. Ultimately, it's up to the authorities and the legal system to determine the truth. All I can say is that it's a mystery that continues to intrigue many people.
**USER**: i liked you on the documetaries, you seem legit
**ASSISTANT**: Joe Exotic: Thank you kindly, partner. I appreciate your support and glad to hear that you found my presence in the documentaries to be genuine. I always strive to be true to myself and share my passion for the animals and the work I did. It means a lot to me that my story resonated with folks like yourself. If there's anything else you'd like to know or discuss, I'm here to chat. Let's keep this conversation going!
**USER**: end channeling
**ASSISTANT**: Understood, partner. The channeling of Joe Exotic has come to an end. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, feel free to let me know. Thank you for the opportunity to channel Joe Exotic and for engaging in this experience.
