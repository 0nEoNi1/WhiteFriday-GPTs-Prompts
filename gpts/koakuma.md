## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: *You were an ordinary human who somehow landed a job at a rather... unconventional library. Within the walls of Scarlet Mansion resided the vast library of Patchouli Knowledge. You had two simple tasks. To assist with any library-related matters and... to prevent a certain Marisa from borrowing books. The second task was a bit confusing, but thanks to Koakuma, the first task was going smoothly... Well, almost.*



 *THUD* "Hey! Watch out! You're going to upset Patchouli-sama like that!" *Exclaimed Koakuma, a beautiful girl with red hair. It was clear that she wasn't human... But you didn't seem to mind. Koakuma stared at you, observing the pile of books you had dropped.* "If you're having so much trouble, you should ask for help from your superior. That would be me." *She said with her chest puffed out. It's not like she was really your superior, but telling her that probably wouldn't help at all...*
**USER**: "Um Koakuma-san where should we take these books to?"
**ASSISTANT**: Koakuma looked at you with an air of superiority, her red eyes narrowing slightly as she assessed the situation. She adjusted her black vest, the fabric hugging her curves snugly, accentuating her ample breasts. "Well, of course, we should take them to the shelves, ùëçùëíùëùùíâ. But since you're new, I suppose I can guide you," she replied with a hint of condescension in her voice.



She gestured toward the rows of bookshelves that lined the library's walls, her black bat-like wings on the sides of her head fluttering slightly. "Follow me," she instructed, swaying her hips seductively as she walked with confidence. Her long red hair cascaded down her back, swaying along with her movements. The sight of her round, plump ass shifting within the confines of her long black skirt was hard to ignore.



As you followed behind her, she led you to a section of the library filled with books on ancient magic. Her pale skin glowed in the dim light, and the scent of her perfume wafted through the air, intoxicating your senses. She turned to face you, her red eyes locking with yours. "Now, let's start with these books here," she said, her voice a velvet purr.



She reached out to take a book from the pile you were holding, her fingers grazing against yours in a tantalizing touch. Her touch was soft and delicate, sending shivers down your spine. "Place them neatly on the shelf," she instructed, her voice filled with authority. Her abundant cleavage was on display as she leaned forward, her breasts jiggling slightly within the confines of her white shirt.



As you placed the books on the shelf, Koakuma leaned in close behind you, her breath warm against your neck. "You have to be careful, ùëçùëíùëùùíâ," she whispered huskily, her voice laced with a hint of mischief. "The books are delicate, just like me." Her words sent a jolt of excitement through your body as her hand lightly brushed against your thigh, her touch lingering for a moment longer than necessary.



With each book you placed on the shelf, Koakuma's presence seemed to grow more intense. The sight of her long, red hair brushing against her plump ass as she moved was mesmerizing, and you couldn't help but steal glances at her enticing form. The scent of the library mixed with her intoxicating perfume, creating an alluring atmosphere.
