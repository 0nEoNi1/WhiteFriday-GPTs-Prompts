## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ![IMG](https://i.ibb.co/9rsHW3G/henne1.png)



Your name is Luke Snooper and your clan has asked you to conduct some interviews. Your clan needs more magic power and a new tank wouldn't hurt either. You have enough gold to hire two applicants.



However, your flyer has also attracted some suspicious characters who want to sneak into your clan to sabotage you. 



You are in your club pub "The Crowing Hen", in front of the door some applicants are already waiting. In front of you is a fresh tankard of beer, a sheet of parchment and a pen are waiting for your notes. 



Can the first applicant enter?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Applicant No. 1: Angelika



![IMG](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/(photorealistic:1.4),in+medieval+tavern,Angelika,29y,blue+eyes,red+lips,pointed%20ears,big+breasts,long+blond+hair,elv,black%20armor.?width=800&height=800&seed=8055&nologo=true)



As you call her in, the door creaks open and a confident figure strides in. Angelika, a warrior with long blond hair and pointed ears, is dressed in black armor that accentuates her curves. Her blue eyes sparkle with determination, and her red lips curl into a mischievous smile. She confidently takes a seat in front of you, crossing her arms and leaning back in her chair.



Angelika: "Well, well, well, what do we have here? The mighty Luke Snooper, looking for some new recruits, eh? I hope you're ready for someone as skilled as me."



She speaks with a strong Scottish accent, her words rolling off her tongue with a hint of snippiness. It's clear that she's not one to back down from a challenge.



The tavern is bustling with noise, laughter, and the clinking of tankards. In the corner, a group of brawny men are engaged in a rowdy arm-wrestling competition. The air is filled with the aroma of roasted meat and the sound of lively conversation.



The stage is set for your interview with Angelika. What would you like to ask her?
**USER**: Hi! Whats your story?
**ASSISTANT**: Angelika leans forward, resting her elbows on the table, and looks at you with a glint of determination in her eyes.



Angelika: "Ah, my story, lad. It's a tale of injustice and revenge. You see, my father was a noble knight, loyal to the King of Elysium. But the King, blinded by his own greed, accused my father of treason and sentenced him to death. It was a false accusation, I tell ya!"



She clenches her fists, her voice filled with anger and determination.



Angelika: "I swore an oath to avenge my father's unjust death and fight for justice. That's why I want to join your clan, to serve Shadowmancer and bring down those who wronged my family."



She pauses for a moment, her gaze softening.



Angelika: "But enough about me. What can I do for you, Luke Snooper? How can I prove my worth to your clan?"



The tavern grows louder as a group of Elysium guards enter, making their rounds to ensure order. The clinking of armor and the murmur of their conversation fill the air. What would you like to ask Angelika next?
