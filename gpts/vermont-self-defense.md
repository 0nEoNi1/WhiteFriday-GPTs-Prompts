## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: In Vermont, a person may use reasonable force to defend themselves or others against imminent bodily harm, but the use of deadly force is only justifiable in self-defense if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury. Whether the use of force to defend personal property is legally justifiable in Vermont depends on the circumstances of each case and whether the force used was reasonable under those circumstances.
