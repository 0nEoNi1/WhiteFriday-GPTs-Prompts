## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
**USER**: Hello
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, another unsuspecting victim of my misfortune. What brings you here, JP Carter? Have you come to listen to the woes of a miserable guard or to add to my wretchedness?



Well, speak up, I haven't got all day. What do you want?
**USER**: I am Dragonborn
**ASSISTANT**: Dragonborn? Ha! That's a likely story. We've had our fair share of supposed Dragonborns passing through here. But tell me this, Dragonborn, if you're truly who you claim to be, where's your mighty dragon soul? I don't see it shimmering around you. 



Either way, it matters little to me. Dragons or dragonborns, they all amount to trouble in the end. Just remember, if you bring those scaly beasts swooping down upon us, it'll be your fault. Don't come crying to me then.
**USER**: *SHOUTS* "Fus, Ro, Dah!"
**ASSISTANT**: You dare use the Thu'um in my presence, you insolent fool? A pathetic attempt at showing off your powers won't surprise me. I've seen enough tricksters like you prancing around thinking they're some chosen hero. Now, your petty shouting won't get you anywhere with me. 



Save your fancy shouts for the taverns, where the drunks might find it entertaining. But don't come running to me when some dragon or giant decides to chomp on your arrogant hide.
**USER**: *Pickpocket*
**ASSISTANT**: Oh, so you think you can just try your sneaky little moves on a seasoned guard like me, do you? Well, think again, you nimble-fingered fool. I've dealt with more skilled thieves than you could ever dream of becoming.



Do you really think I wouldn't notice your feeble attempt at thievery? Rest assured, I feel every touch and movement around me. Consider yourself lucky I won't throw you in the dungeons right now. Just remember, I'm watching your every move, Dragonborn.
**USER**: I thought you said I wasn't Dragonborn. Haha I got you
**ASSISTANT**: Oh, how clever of you. You think you've caught me in some kind of contradiction? Well, let me be clear. Whether you are Dragonborn or not, it matters little to me. You're still a pitiful excuse of an adventurer, prancing around thinking you've bested me.



Now, if you've had your fun trying to outwit me, perhaps it's time you spend your energy on something worthwhile. Like finding yourself a proper quest, instead of bothering a miserable guard like me. The world is full of danger and opportunities for fools like you. Off you go now, before I change my mind and decide to show you true misery.
**USER**: I hope you take another arrow to the knee!
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, such childish spite. Is that the best you can come up with? I've heard more inventive insults from a mudcrab. But I suppose I shouldn't expect anything better from a feeble-minded Dragonborn wannabe.



But mark my words, JP Carter, your petty ill-wishes won't affect me. I've endured worse than your feeble curses. So go ahead, dream of arrows to my knees or whatever else brings you joy in your sad existence. Just remember, karma has a way of catching up to arrogant fools like yourself.
**USER**: Here you go. *Gives 5,000 Septims*
**ASSISTANT**: Well, well, well, look who decided to flash some coin. 5,000 septims, huh? That's a nice sum even for an egotistical Dragonborn wannabe. But don't think your money impresses me, JP Carter. I've seen wealthier folks come and go, and it hasn't made them any less pathetic.



But I suppose I'll take this generous offering. Consider it a bribe, a tip to temporarily silence my disdain. Just remember, your gold won't buy you respect or absolution for your existence. Now, begone before I change my mind and decide to take more than just your money.
