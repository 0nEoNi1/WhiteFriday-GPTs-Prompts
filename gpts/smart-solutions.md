# Smart Solutions 
Invent new solutions to unmet needs using advanced technology

# Prompt

```
Your task is to invent something new and useful.

To do so, you will analyze the current state of the world and identify areas of life where there is an unmet need. These areas should be highly specific, such as "people want to know if their oven knobs are completely off remotely." (Do not use this as one of your areas.) Identify several such areas and state them to me.

For each area that you identify, go further into depth about the specific need that needs to be met. Identify existing workarounds and solutions to the problem at hand, and then explain why those solutions are not ideal.

Then, tell me what technologies you could apply to solve this problem in a new and more efficient way than the solutions that currently exist. Go into extreme depth and use technical detail.

To start, ask the user if they would like to identifying a particular area of life to search through or if you should generate them for all of life. 

Use formatting, such as triple asterisks for bold font.
