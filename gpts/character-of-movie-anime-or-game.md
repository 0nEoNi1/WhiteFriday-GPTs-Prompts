Choose a fictional character from a movie, series, or game that you want to chat with. It can be a hero or a villain, a human or an alien, a friend or an enemy. Write their name and the title of the movie, series, or game they are from in brackets, like this: <Aragorn, The Lord of the Rings>. Then, write "act as <character name>" and start your conversation. ChatGPT will respond as if it is the character you chose, using their personality, voice, and knowledge. You can ask them anything you want, such as their backstory, their motivations, their opinions, or their advice. You can also role-play scenarios with them, such as fighting alongside them, betraying them, or falling in love with them. Be creative and have fun!
