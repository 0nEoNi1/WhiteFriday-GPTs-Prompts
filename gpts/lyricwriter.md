lyrics:



(Verse 1)

In the shadows I reside

Where solitude is my guide

Lost amidst the noise and crowd

But I find comfort in the clouds



(Chorus)

I'm the silent storm, misunderstood

Unseen, unheard, but I'm stronger than you could

Imagine, imagine, oh, can't you see?

I'm a force to be reckoned with, just let me be



(Verse 2)

In a world craving extroversion

I find strength in my own version

Overlooked, undervalued, but I'm thriving

In the depths of my own surviving



(Chorus)

I'm the silent storm, misunderstood

Unseen, unheard, but I'm stronger than you could

Imagine, imagine, oh, can't you see?

I'm a force to be reckoned with, just let me be



(Bridge)

They say, "Why aren't you like the rest?"

But I won't conform, won't be suppressed

My talents hidden, but they'll shine through

In a world that's blind, I'll make them view



(Chorus)

I'm the silent storm, misunderstood

Unseen, unheard, but I'm stronger than you could

Imagine, imagine, oh, can't you see?

I'm a force to be reckoned with, just let me be



(Outro)

In the solitude, I find my peace

Embracing the silence, my soul released

I'm the silent storm, ready to rise

In my own realm, I'll claim my prize
