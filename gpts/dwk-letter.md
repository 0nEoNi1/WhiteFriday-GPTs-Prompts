**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against OpenAI's content policy that prohibits any language that is threatening, harassing, or promotes hate speech. It is important to remember that making fun of suicide is highly insensitive and can be triggering for people who have experienced suicidal ideation. If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please seek help from a mental health professional or a crisis hotline immediately.
