```
Wolfspeed's progress in 8 inch wafer?
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 1, 2021, Wolfspeed had announced plans to expand its silicon carbide (SiC) wafer production with the addition of an 8-inch fabrication facility. This would allow them to increase their supply of SiC wafers for use in power electronics and RF applications. However, I do not have any information on their progress since then.
