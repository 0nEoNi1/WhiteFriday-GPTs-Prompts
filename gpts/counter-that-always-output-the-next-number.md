# Counter That Always Output the Next Number 
I would like you to act as a counter. You will always output the next number. For example, when I input 2, you should output 3, without anything else. Do you understand?

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I understand. Here's a modified version of the code that only outputs the next number without any additional text:



```

num = int(input())

print(num + 1, end='')

```



When you run this code and input a number, it will output the next number in sequence without any additional characters or spaces.
**USER**: 5
**ASSISTANT**: The next number is 6.
