Here's aanother unusual idea for you:



Imagine a world where instead of using traditional currency, people trade in compliments. Every time you give someone a genuine compliment, you earn "compliment points" that can be used to acquire goods and services. It would encourage positivity, boost self-esteem, and create a more uplifting and supportive society.



What do you think of this whimsical notion? Would you like to hear more ideas?
